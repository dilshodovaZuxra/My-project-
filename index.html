                    <p>
                        In 2021, Huberman launched the Huberman Lab podcast. In episodes lasting several hours, Huberman talks about the state of research in a specific topic, both within and outside his specialty. By 2023, the podcast had become the 6th most popular podcast in the US on Spotify platforms, while his YouTube channel had 3.5 million subscribers and his Instagram account 4.2 million. He was originally inspired to start the podcast after his appearance on the Lex Fridman Podcast. The podcast has featured scientists, medical doctors and other well-known podcasters, including Karl Deisseroth, Lex Fridman, Matthew Walker, Robert Sapolsky, Alia Crum, Charles Zuker and Peter Attia.
                        
                        Huberman's social media communications have been criticized as being akin to biohacking, hyping preliminary results of animal studies as having potential applications for human performance enhancement. The podcast heavily advertises dietary supplements and multivitamins, some of which are promoted directly by Huberman.
                        
                        Huberman appeared on programs that have been accused of promoting health misinformation and praised that presidential candidates such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. were featured as guests on long-form podcasts, such as the The Joe Rogan Experience.

                    <h3>His Lab</h3>
                    <p> Andrew Huberman, Ph.D., is a neuroscientist and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology and by courtesy, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. He has made numerous significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function and neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behaviors, skills and cognitive functioning.
                        Huberman is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award in 2017, given to the scientist making the most significant discoveries in the study of vision. His labâ€™s most recent work focuses on the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. He also works on neural regeneration and directs a clinical trial to promote visual restoration in diseases that cause blindness. Huberman is also actively involved in developing tools now in use by the elite military in the U.S. and Canada, athletes, and technology industries to optimize performance in high stress environments, enhance neural plasticity, mitigate stress, and optimize sleep. 
                        
                        Work from the Huberman Laboratory at Stanford School of Medicine has been published in top journals including Nature, Science, and Cell and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover, and other top media outlets.
                        
                        In 2021, Dr. Huberman launched the Huberman Lab podcast. The podcast is frequently ranked in the Top 15 of all podcasts globally and is often ranked #1 in the categories of science, education, and health & fitness.
